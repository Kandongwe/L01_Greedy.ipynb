To do the calculation, I had to think about how the greedy algorithm for the Traveling Salesman program looks at applying the idea of the shortest path between two points, given the application of the distance changing from one point to the next. To implement it, I spent some time thinking about how this can be applied using looks and while statements. My design was to work with the pseudocode. The final result for the execution took longer than I thought it would to implement or draw the graph.\n",
